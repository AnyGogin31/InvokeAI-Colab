## Important Notes

- **Large Models**: Avoid uploading models directly to Google Drive if possible, as some can be very large and take up significant storage.
- **Conda Environment**: Conda is used to create a safe, isolated environment, preventing potential conflicts with Google Colab's system and ensuring smooth execution.

## What's new?

- **Stable Diffusion 3.5 support**: Works smoothly with SD 3.5 as well.
- **FLUX models**: Compatible with the latest FLUX models, ensuring high-quality image generation. _(Use smaller models, as larger ones may crash the tunnel.)_
